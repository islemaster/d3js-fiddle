# d3js-fiddle
A playground for designing [d3js](http://d3js.org/) visualizations.  Not MUCH different from a typical jsfiddle, except:

* Built around making d3js charts and graphs: You input JSON and a render method, and see the graph output.
* Pre-loads d3js and jQuery for use in your script.
* Updates/renders as-you-type.
* Saves your data and script to local storage, so you can close the window and return to continue working on your chart.

Uses [d3js](http://d3js.org/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/).
