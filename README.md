# d3js-fiddle
A playground for designing [D3.js Data-Driven Documents](http://d3js.org/) visualizations.

Features:
* Built for playing with D3.js charts and graphs.
* You provide JSON and a render method, and see the graph output update as you type.
* Autosaves your data and script to local storage, so you can close the window and return later to continue working on your chart.

If my server is up, you can try it at [donatello.bradleycbuchanan.com/d3js-fiddle/](http://donatello.bradleycbuchanan.com/d3js-fiddle/)

Built on [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/).
